==================

The shell script helps the admin to restart the services on their server via emails. You do not need to login into your server. Just send an email on your server with Subject like "nginx restart" and the script processes that email. After processing, the script will send an acknowledgement to authorised users.

To automate the execution, you need to set a cron for it. The cron setup is defined in the script.

You can download the script directly from:
