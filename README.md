==================

The shell script helps the admin to restart the services on their server via emails. You do not need to login into your server. Just send an email on your server and the script processes that emails. After processing, the script will send an acknowledgement to authorised users.

To automate the execution, you need to set a cron for it.

You can download the script directly from:
